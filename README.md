## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:

For the 1st version of the code:

`ipython notebook tensorflow_lstm.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook tensorflow_lstm.ipynb`

For the 2nd version of the code:

`ipython notebook lstm_from_scratch_tensorflow.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook lstm_from_scratch_tensorflow.ipynb`
